# Equistart - The Dao Suite

#### Impact Sector: 
Decentralised Communities and Organisations

#### Startup Stage:
Prototype on celo testnet-alfajores

<br />

## Project Description
Equistart - The DAO Suite aims at creating a full stack DAO suite for a community to create their Decentralised Autonomous Organization with no code and mobile support. Creating a DAO is a tedious task with no single application providing an end-to-end solution and Information. With our dapp, users can easily mint their tokens, raise funds by selling parts of tokens, manage the raised funds (Treasury Management/ AMM), and finally Govern the project bound by tokens in a decentralized and autonomous fashion.

<br />

### Summary:
Internet unlocked a vast universe of new Applications over the past decades and now blockchain is 
revolutionising how we can manage our financial assets over the network of computers in a decentralised manner.
This idea can be extrapolated and can be used to build the future together in a cooperative DAO model.

DAO's vs Traditional Organisations

|Property Rights | Enforced by Police | Tracked on Blockchain |
| Ownership & Governance | Intermediated by Lawyers | Managed through Software |
